# Todo app

First try to make a simple todo app with react front consuming graphql endpoints.
Front will be hosted from the same server as the graphql endpoint, in a single django project.

### plan

* [x] initializing django project
* [x] creating graphql app (using graphene)
* [x] creating models (Todos)
* [x] creating schemas for graphql
* [x] creating the more complicated queries (querying with parameters)
* [x] creating mutations for graphql so it is modifiable
* [x] creating react app
* [x] setting up apollo client to be able to consume graphql
* [x] setting up the UI (creating components)
* [x] adding functionality to the front
* [x] creating react build 
* [x] adding the build to the static folder
* [x] creating frontend app inside the django project to serve the index (later adding url so it can be opened as well)
