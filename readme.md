# Todo app

First try to make a simple todo app with react front consuming graphql endpoints.
Front will be hosted from the same server as the graphql endpoint, in a single django project.

### plan

* [ ] initializing django project
* [ ] creating graphql app (using graphene)
* [ ] creating models (Todos)
* [ ] creating schemas for graphql
* [ ] creating the more complicated queries (querying with parameters)
* [ ] creating react app
* [ ] setting up apollo client to be able to consume graphql
* [ ] setting up the UI (creating components)
* [ ] adding functionality to the front
* [ ] creating react build 
* [ ] adding the build to the static folder
* [ ] creating frontend app inside the django project to serve the index (later adding url so it can be opened as well)
